        There was little first-half goalmouth action to excite a half-empty Cardiff City Stadium. Harry Wilson twice tested Kim Seung-Gyu, with the South Korea goalkeeper reacting well to save the Fulham forward's 13th-minute attempt after good work by Nathan Broadhead.
        Heung-Min Son had the visitors' only on-target effort five minutes before the break as Danny Ward held his 25-yard shot under the crossbar. Moore had the only presentable opportunity of the second period, and the game fizzled out to an end."

        Rest in peace theoretical Elon Musk vs. Mark Zuckerberg super fight, a concept which lasted from June 2023 to August 2023. For a fair portion of those eight weeks, the infamous billionaire brawl built a bit of steam, as photos arose of both parties training with various famous fighters and jiu-jitsu stars in preparation for their grudge match.
        Naturally, it all came apart. Bickering about the location and timing stalled the progression, prompting each man to claim the other was ducking the contest. Zuckerberg still seems interested in competing in some form of MMA, but now he wants to find a new, less complicated opponent.

        It’s one of those fights that fails to make sense on multiple levels. Is Strickland some kind of massive fan favorite that justifies a random title shot? No, he’s popular on Twitter with those who are somehow not yet bored of his cringy schtick. Does his stand-up-straight-throw-arm-punches-and-parry striking style threaten arguably the best kickboxer in mixed martial arts (MMA) history?"

        "During an appearance on Trae Young's 'From The Point' podcast, Chicago Bulls point guard Lonzo Ball confirmed that he'll miss the entirety of the 2023-24 NBA season.
        Back in March, Ball had a cartilage transplant in his left knee — his third surgery on that knee since he initially got hurt in January of 2022.
        '[I'm] just taking it day by day, bro. I just had a really big surgery. Hopefully, the last one I ever have to get,' Ball said. 'It's a long process. I'm already out this whole next season.'
        The fact that Ball will be sidelined all season isn't too surprising, as Bulls executive vice president of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas hinted that this might be the case back in June.
        “Everything is going well,” Karnisovas said at the time. “I think our expectation is that he’s not coming back next season and he’s going to continue on his recovery. If he comes back, it would be great.”"
